# drawingfinalproject

For my final project, I would like to recreate the experience of living in a city, especially coming from my suburbia background. I want to focus on neighborhoods in the city that are less touristy, like the East Village, and really show what goes on during the day and at night. I would like to demonstrate how many things are happening at once without us even realizing it. I will use simple and beautiful SVG graphics and CSS, along with some minor HTML other than the main access page which will have primarily HTML with a beatiful, minimal design. I will create animations with a mix of SVG, CSS, Javascript, and if appropriate, HTML canvas. For example, animations will include a woman opening a window and yelling out of it, a taxi honking at pedestrians, etc. There will be many animations that are triggered through interactivity, but also rolling animations that will be altered through interactions. For example, I will include some ‘hide and seek’ animations, such as hovering over a manhole that a rat will then pop off of. Other interactive animations will including flicking lights on and off, and the ability to change day time to night time. Along with the main access page, each drawing will be “connected spatially,” where transitions between pages will make the user feel like the page environment has not reloaded.
